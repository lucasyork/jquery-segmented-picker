jquery-segmented-picker
==================

This plugin is simply wrapper for text input to become picker for any format you wish. 

The main idea in it is to avoid showing complicated popups while there is possibility to use keyboard only. That way you can incorporate it in any more complex forms without worrying about UX.

We will use it mainly as simple time picker, time duration picker and maybe as currency picker.

Usage:
$('input').segmentPicker({
    segments: [ segment, segment, ... ]
})

Possible segments
